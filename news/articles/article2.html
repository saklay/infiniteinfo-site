<P>Infinite Information is proud to announce the launch of the official website of the Fookien Times <A HREF="http://www.philippinesyearbook.com/" TARGET="_blank">Philippines Yearbook</A>.  Through this site, web surfers can learn all there is to know about this prestigious publication which has chronicled the progress of the Philippines since 1936.  Visitors can also securely order the Philippines Yearbook online using their credit cards.
<P>The site features several characteristics that set it apart from your average website.   Just like the print version, the site breaks the rules of conventional design giving the visitor a unique aesthetic experience.  For example, the dynamic home page gives you a new screen each time you visit it.  Unlike other web sites where every page looks alike, each section of www.philippinesyearbook.com offers a different look without breaking the continuity of  the entire site.
<P>Another highlight of the site is its e-commerce capabilities. Users can actually order the book online via credit card. This is done in a totally secure manner using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) technologies.   While this technology is being widely used in the U.S. and abroad, it's still not that common here in the Philippines. The Philippines Yearbook aims to break new ground in this area.
